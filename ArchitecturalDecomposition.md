# ARCHITECTURAL DECOMPOSITION

The following section dives deep into the components used, operational mechanism, environmental sustainability and cost effectiveness, comparative analysis and potential applications
## **I. Efficient Computing Node** 

The Efficient Computing Node is the thin client component in the Lubera Architecture inspired by the design of Single Board Computers. It functions as a highly optimized hardware gateway to high performance servers. It strips away non-essential computing overhead, focusing purely on performance-critical tasks such as user interaction management, event handling, and efficient UI rendering. It differs from conventional thin clients because of this.The operates directly on the hardware, bypassing traditional thin client OS overhead. It includes all the necessary provisions needed to connect to a screen, input devices, and other peripheral devices.

## **II. Primary Event Handler and Communication Interface**

This interface is designed for the primary purpose of detecting, interpreting , and managing input events from peripheral devices such as keyboard and mice. It employs standard communication protocols, including but not limited to USB to HID, to ensure seamless interaction with downstream modules. 

**A. Mouse Event Module**

1) Identification: It detects raw mouse signals (left-clicks, right-clicks, scroll actions) using
interrupt-driven mechanisms, recognizing distinct patterns like button presses and movements.
2) Conversion: Detected signals are converted into a standardized format, encoding event type,
coordinates, timestamp, and metadata.
3) Segregation: An algorithm segregates mouse events by characteristics, differentiating left-clicks, and right-clicks.
4) Formatting: Segregated events are formatted for integration with system components, detailing
event type, coordinates, and timestamp.

**B. Keyboard Event Module**
1. Identification: It uses interrupt driven techniques to capture keyboard signals,
distinguishing key presses and releases and recording key codes.
2. Conversion: Coverts keyboard events into a standardized format with key code, timestamp and
meta data.
3. Segrgegation: Segregates key by type (alphanumeric, function keys, modifiers) and handles
special keys (Enter, Backspace, Tab) uniquely.


## **III. User Interface Management System**

The User Interface Management System delineated herein is predicated on a novel paradigm for graphical user interfaces (GUIs), fundamentally diverging from traditional rendering methods. This system leverages static images, pre-stored within client-endpoint memory, to represent the various frontends of a software application's interface, including but not limited to the desktop environment and its suite of applications.

#### **A. Templates and Templating:**

The system employs a templating architecture where each template serves as a structural foundation or 'skeleton' for the user interface. These templates are constituted by frontend assets, which are inherently devoid of semantic content. They are meticulously crafted to accommodate additional, semantically meaningful assets during runtime. In their dormant state, these frontend assets encompass static components of the user interface, such as background images, layout stylings, asset placements, and delineated content boxes reserved for texts and images.

It is critical to note that while certain elements, such as tooltips, button labels, and menu names, may be embedded as static components due to their unchanging nature throughout the application's lifecycle, dynamic content like text fields in a messaging platform, are excluded. These dynamic areas are defined within the templates by specified bounding boxes, marked by coordinates (X_min, Y_min, X_max, Y_max). During runtime, these bounding boxes serve as receptacles for the insertion of dynamic data or text, as necessitated by user interaction or system processes.

Templates are stored in a non-volatile memory of the client endpoint in a pre-compiled image/pixel buffer format. This design choice optimizes access speed and rendering efficiency. Each template is assigned a unique Template ID (TID) for retrieval and identification purposes. For contextual integrity, templates are also categorized by application, each denoted by a specific prefix.

**Illustration:**

- "T1": "Home.png"
- "T2": "Login.png"
- "T3": "Forgot_password.png"
- "T4": "Createaccount.png", etc.

The Template Management System (TMS) is responsible for the resolution and scaling of these images upon display. This system facilitates direct transmission of pre-compiled templates to display hardware, effectively circumventing the traditionally resource-intensive rendering process. During system initialization, a predefined template (e.g., homepage) is automatically rendered.

#### **B. Mapping Tables:**

The Mapping Tables within the User Interface Management System are pivotal for the accurate identification and interaction management of various user interface elements. These tables form a crucial part of the system's architecture, allowing for precise definition and functionality of interactive components within the static templates. Below is a detailed exposition of these tables:

1. **Structure and Functionality**:
    - Each mapping table is associated with a specific template and contains a collection of entries.
    - Each entry in the table corresponds to an interactable element within the template, such as buttons, input fields, or dynamic content areas.
    - The structure of an entry typically comprises a bounding box, an Event Identifier (EID), an associated Template ID (TID), and a descriptive name for the element.
2. **Bounding Box**:
    - The bounding box is defined by a set of coordinates: (X_min, Y_min, X_max, Y_max).
    - These coordinates delineate the interactive area of an element within the template, providing a spatial definition for user interactions.
    - The bounding box allows the system to detect and respond accurately to user inputs, such as clicks or text entry, within specific areas of the interface.
3. **Event Identifier (EID)**:
    - The EID is a unique identifier linked to a specific user action or event.
    - It facilitates the communication between the client interface and the server, triggering appropriate responses or actions when an interaction occurs.
    - For example, an EID may be associated with the action of opening a file or submitting a form.
4. **Associated Template ID (TID)**:
    - Each interactable element may be linked to another template, indicated by an associated TID.
    - This linkage enables seamless navigation or interaction flows within the application, such as transitioning from a login page to a home page.
5. **Element Name**:
    - The name attribute provides a human-readable identifier for each interactable element.
    - This feature aids in development and debugging processes, offering clarity and ease of reference for system developers.
6. **Examples of Mapping Table Entries**:
    a. Clickable Elements:
    `{   'T14': [     {'bounding_box': (5, 128, 483, 214), 'eid': 'EID123', 'associated_tid': 'T15', 'name': 'file1'},     ...   ] }`
    - Here, the entry for 'file1' in template 'T14' specifies the area of interaction, the event triggered, the subsequent template, and the element's name.
    
    b. Input Fields:
    `{   'T17': [{'bounding_box': (428, 637, 1000, 708), 'eid': 'EID1400', 'name': 'input'}],   ... }`
    -  This entry maps an input field in template 'T17', detailing the area for text entry, the event linked to data input, and a label for the field.
    
    c. Dynamic Content Boxes:
    `{   'automated_overlays_T23': {     'A1': {'bounding_box': (1, 227, 293, 320), 'eid': 'EID193', 'name': 'conv1'},     ...   },   ... }`
    
    - In this instance, various areas within template 'T23' are designated for dynamic content display, each defined by a bounding box and associated EID.

The implementation of these Mapping Tables embodies the system's commitment to precision and user-centric design. By meticulously defining the interaction points within the static templates, the system ensures a responsive, intuitive, and efficient user experience.

#### C. Template Lifecycle Management:

This subsection outlines the lifecycle of templates within the Lubera User Interface Management System, emphasizing the creation process, the fixed nature of templates post-manufacturing, and the conditions under which changes are permissible.

1. **Creation Process**:
    
    - **Design Phase**:
        - Developers utilize a suite of graphical design tools to create the visual elements of each template. This process involves careful consideration of layout, color schemes, and user interaction flow.
        - The focus is on ensuring that the templates are intuitive and aesthetically pleasing while maintaining functional clarity.
        
    - **Mapping Table Construction**:
        - An integral part of template creation is the construction of mapping tables. For this, developers use a specialized interface provided by the Lubera system.
        - This interface enables developers to identify interactable elements within the template. They do this by selecting the top-right and bottom-left corners of an element, defining its bounding box.
        - Developers then associate each interactable element with a corresponding Template ID, indicating which template the user will navigate to upon interaction.
        - Additionally, each element is linked to a specific Event Identifier (EID) that defines the type of user interaction it supports (e.g., click, input, etc.).
        
2. **Template Hardcoding and Manufacturing**:

    - In the Lubera variant under discussion, templates are hardcoded into the system pre-manufacturing. This means that the templates, once integrated into the system, are fixed and not subject to alteration post-production.
    - This approach ensures a stable and reliable user experience, as the hardcoded templates are extensively tested and validated before deployment.
    
3. **Conditional Template Modification**:
    
    - While the standard operation involves fixed templates, there are scenarios where Lubera allows for template modifications. These exceptions are, however, rare and typically subject to strict controls.
    - Modification allowances are usually made in response to significant user feedback, critical updates, or to accommodate specific functional enhancements that are deemed essential post-deployment.
    - Any such modifications follow a rigorous approval and testing process to ensure they meet the same high standards of quality and functionality as the original templates.

This comprehensive lifecycle management ensures that templates within the Lubera system are not only of high quality at the outset but also maintain their integrity and efficacy throughout their usage. The process balances the need for a stable, reliable user interface with the potential necessity for critical updates, adhering to Lubera's commitment to excellence in user experience.

#### **D. Inheritance**

A crucial innovation in the Lubera User Interface Management System is the implementation of an object-oriented approach to template design, centered around a robust system of template inheritance and hierarchy. This structure is particularly effective in optimizing resources in memory-intensive environments, as we are storing the images of each unique graphical user interface. 

1. **Hierarchical Template Structure**:
    - **Parent-Child Relationship**: The system is designed with a parent-child relational model where 'parent' templates define common elements used across multiple views or 'child' templates.
    - **Efficiency in Memory Usage**: By allowing child templates to inherit elements from parent templates, the system significantly reduces the amount of storage required. This is particularly advantageous in environments where memory resources are limited or where efficient use of storage is critical.
    
2. **Example of Inheritance in Action**:
    - Consider an application with a consistent toolbar visible across multiple pages. In the Lubera system, this toolbar would be defined once in a parent template.
    - Subsequent child templates, representing different pages or views within the application, would inherit the toolbar from the parent template. This approach dramatically cuts down on the need to duplicate common elements, reducing redundancy and saving valuable memory space.
    
3. **Template Merging Algorithm (TMA)**:
    - **Development Aid**: During the development phase, developers can rely on their visual judgment or utilize the Template Merging Algorithm (TMA) provided by the system.
    - **Functionality**: The TMA scans through both parent and child templates to identify and consolidate overlapping elements. This process ensures that common elements are defined just once in the parent template and appropriately inherited by child templates.
    - **Practical Application**: For instance, if two templates share a common background design or other GUI elements but require different functionalities or content, each can inherit the shared elements from a parent template while maintaining their unique identifiers and functionalities.

By leveraging the principles of inheritance and hierarchy, the Lubera User Interface Management System introduces a level of efficiency and resource optimization that is particularly advantageous in remote computing solutions. This architecture not only saves storage but also streamlines the development process, making it more intuitive and efficient for developers to create consistent and high-performing user interfaces.

## **IV. Template Interaction Module (TIM)**

The Template Interaction Module (TIM) in the Lubera Desktop environment plays a critical role in processing and managing user interactions, specifically clicks and keyboard inputs. This module ensures that every user interaction leads to a predetermined, consistent outcome.

**A. Overview of Event Handling:**

1. **Event Definition**: Events within the Lubera system can originate from user actions, system triggers, or other sources. Primary interactions include clicks and keyboard inputs.
2. **Event Detection and Transmission**: The Primary Event Handler and Communication Interface detect these events and relay them to the TIM for processing.

**B. Clicks Processing:**

1. **Functionality**:
    - The TIM manages user clicks by correlating them with interactable elements defined in the active template.
    - Click detection is based on coordinate mapping within bounding box coordinates of each element.
2. **Operational Logic**:
    - For a click at coordinates (x, y), the system checks if it falls within the bounding box (x1, y1, x2, y2) of any interactable element.
    - If the click is within a bounding box, the corresponding entry is activated.
3. **Event Notification**:
    - The system generates notifications in the format: `["eventType": "leftClick/rightClick", "coordinates": "[x,y]", "timestamp": timestamp]`.
4. **Output Generation**:
    - Post click-processing, the system outputs an Event ID (EID) for server communication and a Template ID (TID) for updates via the Template Management System (TMS).

**C. Keyboard Input Processing:**

1. **Input Field Activation**:
    - Input fields are activated similarly to clicks, where a click within an input field's bounding box readies the field for data entry.
2. **Data Handling**:
    - Typed characters are captured and displayed on screen in real-time (type preview).
    - The system handles special keys and, upon a designated key press (e.g., Enter), forwards the typed text to the network module along with the corresponding EID.
3. **Event Notification for Keyboard Input**:
    - Notifications are structured as: `{"eventType": "keyboardInput", "key": "keycode", "action": "press/release", "timestamp": timestamp}`

**D. Integration with Other Modules:**

1. **Reception of Event Notifications**:
    - The TIM is configured to handle a large volume of data from the Event Handler and Communication Interface.
    - Direct server event notifications are processed, which may include directives or updates for the client components.
2. **Initial Processing**:
    - Upon receipt of notifications, the TIM categorizes and interprets events based on their nature and context.
    - This initial processing determines the pathway for each event within the TIM for further action or response.

**E. Engress Point of TIM:**

1. **Provision of Specific Request Details**:
    - The Engress Point details information related to user requests or system commands, crucial for targeted module actions or updates.
    - It acts as a dispatcher, directing processed data to the correct destination within the Efficient Computing Node (ECN).
2. **Forwarding of Outputs**:
    - Outputs, including UI updates, data storage, or command execution, are forwarded to relevant system components.
    - This process is governed by predefined rules and logic, ensuring efficient and accurate information distribution to modules like the Overlay Module, data storage systems, or other specialized components.

## **V. Overlay Module**

The Overlay Module is a cornerstone of the Lubera User Interface Management System, designed to integrate dynamic content, such as text and images, into statically-defined user interface templates. This module plays a crucial role in merging real-time data from the server with the static elements of the user interface, maintaining both the integrity and clarity of the overall design.
#### A. **Textual Content Rendering and Overlay**:

The Overlay Module's role is to processing and displaying textual content within user interfaces. This mechanism initiates with the intricate processing of text data received from the server. The module adeptly transforms textual data into a pixel-based format, adhering to pre-defined font and size  specifications, thereby ensuring visual clarity and consistency A core component of this process is an integrated event handler, tasked with coordinating the conversion of plain text into a graphical format suitable for overlay onto static user interface templates.

This conversion is executed by a specialized text rendering module, signifying the module's proficiency in handling text data. Once rendered, the text is meticulously placed within the user interface, guided by a well-defined coordinate system. This system is pivotal in ensuring the precise alignment of text, contributing to a structured and legible display. An example of this process is illustrated through Python code, demonstrating the mechanism of rendering and overlaying text.

```python
# Example Python code for illustrating text rendering
def render_text(text_data, font, size):
# Convert text data into pixel-based representation
rendered_text = pixel_based_rendering(text_data, font, size)
return rendered_text
# Overlay text onto the template
def overlay_text(rendered_text, coordinates):
# Place text at specified coordinates on the UI template
place_text_on_template(rendered_text, coordinates)
```

#### B. **Graphical Content Rendering and Overlay**:

Complementing the textual overlay, the module is equally proficient in managing graphical content, namely images. The process begins with the reception of image data, which is then subjected to optimization techniques, balancing the quality with bandwidth constraints. The optimized images are strategically overlaid onto designated regions of the templates, guided by the module's coordinate system. This placement is not only visually harmonious but also functionally interactive, responding to user inputs and enhancing the user experience.
```python
Example Illustration
# Example Python code for image overlay
def process_image(image_data):
# Compress and optimize the image
optimized_image = optimize_image(image_data)
return optimized_image
# Overlay image onto the template
def overlay_image(optimized_image, coordinates):
# Place image at specified coordinates on the UI template
place_image_on_template(optimized_image, coordinates)
```

#### C. **Rendering Efficiency and Synchronization**:

1. **Techniques for Enhanced Rendering**: The Overlay Module employs methods like double or triple buffering and a direct-to-display approach to ensure timely rendering, which is particularly crucial in environments with limited resources.
2. **Synchronization with Display Module**: This synchronization between text and image overlays with the display module is essential to prevent delays and content overlaps.
#### D. **Automated Overlays**:

Automated Overlays are initiated upon the opening of specific templates within the user interface. This process is inherently driven by server-sent Event Identifiers (EIDs), which serve as the primary triggers for the automated content population. When a template is activated, the system checks for any associated EIDs, and upon identification, it commences the process of overlaying the designated content onto the template. The functionality of Automated Overlays is deeply embedded in the system's ability to interpret and act upon the received EIDs. Each EID corresponds to predefined content that needs to be displayed within the template. This content typically comprises textual data but may also include images or other
multimedia elements, depending on the template's requirements and the nature of the EID.

**Illustrative Example of Automated Overlays**

Consider a scenario where the system processes an Event Identifier "a" for a template "T6". Upon receiving this EID, the system retrieves the associated data, which might include various lines of text or image references. This data is then methodically overlaid onto the template at specified coordinates,
ensuring that each piece of content is accurately positioned within the template's layout.

A detailed example of the server-side process might look like this:
```json 
Processing EID: 'a' for template: 'T6' Data received for EID 'a': [ {'cardname': 'ed1', 'line1': 'Total
Appointments Today - 18', 'line2': 'Pending Lab Results - 5', ...}, ... ] Overlaying text at (909, 155,
1383, 320) with lines: ['Total Appointments Today - 18', 'Pending Lab Results - 5', ...] Placing text:
'Total Appointments Today - 18' at (909, 155) ...
```
In this example, the system identifies the EID 'a', retrieves the corresponding data, and proceeds to overlay this information onto the specified regions of the template 'T6'. The coordinates (e.g., 909, 155, 1383, 320) indicate the precise location on the template where the text content is to be displayed.

**System Constraints and Adaptability**

While Automated Overlays provide a seamless and efficient means of populating templates with
content, their functionality is bounded by certain system constraints. These constraints include the
limitations imposed by the template's design and the client-side capabilities. The system ensures that
the overlay actions do not exceed these boundaries, maintaining the stability and integrity of the user
interface.
#### E. **Interacted Overlays**:

The primary function of Interacted Overlays is to capture and display user inputs instantaneously on the screen. This process is driven by the Template Interaction Module (TIM), which plays a critical role in detecting and managing user keystrokes. The interaction begins when the user selects a text input field making it active. The TIS identifies this action determining the specific field the user intends to interact with. As the user commences typing, the TIS dynamically changes each keystroke in real time.

**Dynamic Text Overlay**

The captured text is immediately overlayed onto the active text field in the UI. This dynamic overlay provides users with a live preview of their input, enhancing the interactive nature of the interface. The overlay process involves updating the text display within the field as the user continues to
type, ensuring that the user's input is accurately and promptly reflected on the screen.

**User Experience Enhancement**

Interacted Overlays are designed with a strong emphasis on user experience. They facilitate a highly interactive and responsive interface, where the immediate visual representation of user inputs plays a central role.

- Real-Time Feedback: As users type, the immediate overlay of their text into the input fields provides an essential feedback mechanism. This feature is particularly advantageous in scenarios that require precision and accuracy in data entry.
- Adaptive Display: The system adapts to various types of user inputs, whether it's short text entries or longer compositions. The overlay process is flexible enough to accommodate different input lengths and formats, maintaining the integrity and readability of the text within the UI.

**Illustrative Example**

Consider a user interacting with a form on the UI. As the user clicks on a field and begins typing, the
system captures and displays each character in real-time within that field. For instance:

- User clicks on the 'Name' field and types "John Doe".
- As the user types, each letter is overlayed in the 'Name' field: "J", "Jo", "Joh", "John", "John D",
"John Do", "John Doe".
- The text "John Doe" is continuously visible in the field, providing the user with an immediate
and accurate preview of their input.

#### F. **Guided Overlays**:

Guided Overlays are characterized by their server-driven configuration, where specific instructions for text and image manipulation are issued from the server. These directives are typically triggered by predefined events or user actions and dictate how content should be displayed or adjusted within the
user interface.

1. Directive-Driven Process
- The process begins with the server issuing directives to the client’s Overlay Module. These directives contain detailed instructions on how text and images should be manipulated and displayed within the UI.
- The instructions might include details like the position, line placement, size, color, and other properties of the content, ensuring that each element is presented according to the intended design and functionality.

2. Content Placement and Adjustment
- Upon receiving these directives, the Overlay Module interprets and implements them precisely. This involves placing text and images in specific areas of the UI or making adjustments to existing content.
- The process is dynamic and can include a wide range of modifications, such as changing text content, resizing images, or repositioning elements to suit the current context or user needs.

3. Illustration
The transformation and formatting of data in the server side must be compatible and in a format easily understandable by the client endpoint. Here is an example of we can perform a line driven special directive data transmission

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
function transformAppointmentData(appointment) {
return {
[appointment["Appointment ID"]]: {
"line 1": appointment["Patient Name"],
"line 2": appointment["Doctor"],
"line 3": appointment["Purpose"]
}
};
}
module.exports = function getCalendar() {
const appointmentsData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname,
'../data/appointments.json'), 'utf8'));
return appointmentsData.map(transformAppointmentData);
};
---
```

Here is a representation of how the client side might handle the formatted data in python:
```python
elif eid == 'd':
# Mapping for EID 'd'
ap_mappings = {
"Ap1": (732, 272, 877, 326),
"Ap2": (728, 356, 872, 413),
"Ap3": (736, 450, 879, 505),
"Ap4": (734, 549, 885, 606),
"Ap5": (742, 639, 884, 695)
# Add more mappings if necessary
}
for appointment in data:
ap_id = list(appointment.keys())[0]
lines = [appointment[ap_id]["line 1"], appointment[ap_id]["line 2"], appointment[ap_id]["line
3"]]
bounding_box = ap_mappings.get(ap_id)
if bounding_box:
overlay_text(canvas, bounding_box, lines)
```

2. Integration with Event Routing Systems: Seamlessly integrates with the server’s event routing mechanisms, ensuring a fluid flow of data
throughout the architecture.

#### **VIII. Event Handling Subsystem**

**A. Overview**
The Event Handling Subsystem is designed for sophisticated processing and management of user generated events. It operates as a core element in the server-side architecture, ensuring the efficient and accurate handling of diverse event types.

**B. Components**

**1. Primary Event Handler**
- Function and Designation: The PEH operates as a static, pre-configured module within the subsystem. It is designed to process rapid Event Identifier (EID) inputs, ensuring swift response to standard, repetitive user-generated events.
- Mapping Protocol: The PEH implements a direct 'EID to Directive' mapping protocol. This efficient mapping system enables quick translation of user events into actionable directives within the server environment.

An illustration of primary event handling in javascript:
```javascript

const getHome = require('./messenger/home')
const getEmma = require('./messenger/emma')
const getJohn = require('./messenger/john')
const getRon = require('./messenger/ron')

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Event Handler Table (EHT)
const EHT = {
  'EID48': getHome,
  'EID201': getJohn,
  'EID202': getRon,
  'EID203': getEmma
  // ... (Other EID mappings)
};
    if (EHT[eid]) {
        const data = EHT[eid](req.body);
        res.json(data);
    } else {
        console.log(`Event ID not found: ${eid}`);
        res.status(404).send('Event ID not found');
    }
});
```

**2. Secondary Event Handler**
- Dynamic Functionality: The SEH is tailored for more complex and dynamic EID processing. It incorporates additional contextual data and metadata for a deeper, more nuanced analysis of events
- Adaptive Configuration: The SEH is adept at managing variable user interaction patterns making it an essential component for handling non-standard, complex events that require a little more of processing.

An illustration of secondary event handling:
```
    // Special handling for EID1400
    if (eid === 'EID1400' && recentEID) {
        const updatedData = appendToChatFileAndReturn(recentEID, content);
        if (updatedData) {
            res.json(updatedData);
        } else {
            res.status(400).send('Invalid EID for conversation update');
        }
        return;
    }
```

**C. Integration**

**1. Unified Operation**
- **Modular Interaction:** Both the PEH and SEH are integrated into a unified subsystem. This integration ensures coherent and harmonized data processing within the Lubera Framework.
- **Seamless Data Flow:** The event handlers work in tandem to maintain a seamless flow of event
data, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

**2. Application-Specific Processing**
**Customized Event Management:** The subsystem is adept at handling events specific to different applications within the Lubera Framework. This customized approach allows for the tailored processing of events, aligning with the specific requirements of each application.

**D. Illustrative Example**

Consider an example where the Event Handling Subsystem processes a user event related to a
document editing application:

- Event Reception: The subsystem receives an EID corresponding to a text editing action within adocument.
- PEH Processing: The PEH quickly identifies the EID as a standard text modification event andmaps it to a predefined directive for text processing.
- SEH Involvement: If the text editing involves complex formatting or contextual considerations, the SEH steps in to analyze additional metadata and context, ensuring the nuanced handling of the event.

This example demonstrates the subsystem's ability to efficiently categorize and process events, whether they require straightforward handling by the PEH or more complex processing by the SEH.

## IX. Directive Execution Engine
